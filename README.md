Wheat Seeds Dataset


The Wheat Seeds Dataset involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat.

It is a multiclass (3-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 210 observations with 7 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Area(A)
Perimeter(P)
Compactness(C)
Length of kernel(L)
Width of kernel(W)
Asymmetry coefficient(AC)
Length of kernel groove(LG)
Class (One, Two, Three).
